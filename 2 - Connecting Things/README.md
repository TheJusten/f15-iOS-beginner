### What We Did

* Created three buttons that made a text label change three different colors.
* Learned about IBOutlets and IBActions. Learned a bit about the interface for creating outlets [here](http://www.codetuition.com/ios-tutorials/connecting-iboutlets-ibactions-the-fast-way/).
* Used the `textColor` property on a UILabel to change the label's color. Learned how to explore UIView with Apple's documentation.
* Added Auto Layout constraints to the buttons to keep them in the correct position, regardless of device orientation or size. See [this tutorial](http://www.appcoda.com/introduction-auto-layout/) for a very similar application of Auto Layout
